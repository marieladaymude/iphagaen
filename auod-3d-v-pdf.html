Most 3D phones have an autostereoscopic parallax barrier display (glasses-free 3D display) and some also have a 3D camera and a 3D output Сферорамная киносистема, основанная на использовании кадра киноплёнки формата imax, и рассчитанная на демонстрацию фильма на экран в виде купола.

It could be the smartphone in your pocket, the tablet on your coffee table, that wireless modem in your briefcase… it could even be that navigation system in your car or that action camera strapped to your chest. 
Total budget and country of purchase: UK, total budget £300 including the device, keyboard and stylus Do you prefer a 2 in 1 form factor, good battery life or best specifications for the money? Pick or include any that apply. Yep, need the the 2 in 1 form factor really. Decent battery is a good thing but equally I'll be at a desk at times so can charge it. Then the best specs I can get I guess. How important is weight and thinness to you? Not of utmost importance Why the blank look? Just a temporary site glitch.

I am an EE student who is currently interning for the second year at the same company. During my first year, I designed a simple IO board with a couple uC's, a bunch of relays, some opto-isolated inputs, etc. It was two layers, and I was pretty happy with the results for it being my first "professional" design. Fast forward to this year, and I was given the task of designing another PCB. Before I get into that, here is some background. My mentor is a test engineer, and naturally Hi. I'm not a professional game developer. I started doing this as a hobby years ago, but I'm finally working on a bigger project, what will be a full 3D game developed in Unity. I just want to share my experience and the steps I took to learn game development. First of all, I'm a Linux user and I still refuse to use windows on a daily basis. I just use it with Unity, nothing else. I can't get used to it yet. Fortunately Linux is more suitable for my job. So I started using the C++ Allegr. I'm getting rid of all of these since I'd rather buy techno records with the earned money then keeping them in my rack. Some rare EP's in here (Emperor - Begin, Chroma Chords boxset) Hit me up if you're interested in the lot or individual 12"s, shipping to countries next to Belgium is cheap.

I just put together a new computer using a Gigabyte "GA-Z97X-Gaming 3" motherboard. I picked several parts and the case specifically to be very quiet. However, I can always hear one fan going berserk inside. I've used HWMonitor and can see that all other fans (2 140mm case fans and the optional CPU fan) are always spinning at 500-700 RPM. One fan though, the main CPU fan, is always going at 1800+ RPM. It is one of a pair included in a "Noctua NH-U9B SE2". I did some research about 3-pin 
I run a hospital-based print lab ( Cardiac3DPrintLab.com ( and often run into the difficulty of getting clinicians to review 3D models prior to printing. I am currently experimenting with WebGl and X3D options, but my biggest success so far is using 3DPDFs (most clinicians already have Adobe reader on their machines). However, I would like to annotate features in the PDF. A standard comment will disappear once the model is rotated. Adobe built in 3DComments. Hey! I'm trying to create my own business cards and get them printed. Did this whole design on 300dpi, CMYK, saved in SWOP v.2, saved as a Press Quality image. Didn't think I rasterized too much but maybe I did? I know the tree side is pixelated because the image is low quality so i'm trying to find a better quality picture of that painting, but I also shrank it and things get better quality when shrunk so i'm just overall lost here. I've done this before and I'm not sure what I'm doing wrong I am considering doing a full scale body scan at Doob3D. There is a pop up store in manhattan, and they give you a 3D PDF file for . Is there a difference in file type? What file is a 3D COLOR PDF versus a normal wireframe model. So everyone i know who sells is in the process of leaving the town i'm in, but luckily a few shops have opened up. After doing some searching on line i came across this ( application. As a Dutch social science teacher, I'm really interested in how other countries and schools deal with the subject. In the Netherlands social studies is a mandatory one year class for the upper secondary students, whereas social science is an elective for either two or three years (depending on the level the student is taking). What is teaching social science like in your school? And how do you deal with that content wise? Edit In the Netherlands students get one year of social science. Hey guys ı find a helpful document about Stereoscopic 3D view principles http://www.sky.com/shop/export/sites/www.sky.com/shop/__PDF/3D/Basic_Principles_of_Stereoscopic_3D_v1.pdf. Last week I uploaded my new book on 3D printing to Thingiverse, only to have it immediately removed my Makerbot moderators, even though it was proving to be a very popular, with nearly a thousand downloads in the first 48 hours. In my chapter on model repositories, I wrote that Makerbot owning Thingiverse was a conflict of interest, and I suspect that this is why they are censoring my work. This is actually my second book on 3D printing. My first. 
Here's the situation: my wife and I just closed on a four story townhouse yesterday. Our first house! That's not the issue. The issue is the fact that there's an open column that runs the entire height of the building. Column's size is about 8' x 4' x 4 stories. We have two cats that have never lived outside of a one-story building. In addition, they are both klutzy. I am certain that they are going to walk up the stairs to the top of the column, decide that they need to see what's outside. </p>
